                    The chapter starts with Madeline and Theo stopping by a campfire to rest. Madeline explains that
                    Part of Her
                    escaped from a mirror and is haunting her, and that she consists of all the things she isn't very
                    proud of,
                    that the mountain may have given her an actual body. She also thanks Theo for helping her through
                    the
                    journey. Theo tells Madeline that she reminds him of his sister, Alex, who has a similar way of
                    challenging
                    herself and has a lot of similar problems she's struggling with. Madeline later explains that she
                    struggles
                    with depression and is very anxious, and that she usually doesn't talk about it, that nobody except
                    her
                    mother actually knows about her mental problems. Climbing the mountain is a way to challenge herself
                    and to
                    accomplish something huge. After the long conversation, they decide to take themselves a selfie as a
                    way to
                    remember the night before they go to sleep.
                    In a dream sequence, Madeline starts to understand that she can't run away from her problems and
                    that she
                    has to deal with them somehow, however her decision is to set Part of Her free. Badeline didn't want
                    to be
                    abandoned, becoming enraged at her and traps her for trying to leave her while she was trying her
                    best to
                    help the protagonist. Frightened, she starts panicking again. Trying to calm herself down with the
                    feather
                    technique taught by Theo, Badeline interrupts it and cuts the feather in half, throwing her down to
                    the
                    ground. In real life, Madeline slips off the edge and falls into a very deep chasm.
                    Madeline's fall is broken by her landing in water after falling through multiple layers of crystals.
                    Lost
                    in a crystal cavern, she starts to lose hope in her being able to climb the mountain. She's angry
                    that she
                    was very close to the summit but Badeline caused her to fall down all the way back down. The area
                    and the
                    sad, melancholic music set the theme of hopelessness. The protagonist tries to find her way out of
                    this.
                    During her way out, she finds the Old Woman who seems to think at first that she's given up on her
                    task.
                    Madeline explains that she fell down and Part of Her is the reason why she's unable to reach the
                    summit.
                    Granny suggests that she should talk to Badeline and assumes she may be scared of climbing the
                    mountain. The
                    protagonist decides to go ahead with the suggestion.
                    After chasing her for some time, Madeline finally finds Part of Herself, and tries to apologise for
                    being
                    selfish and attempting to leave her instead of actually helping. Badeline doesn't believe her,
                    triggering a
                    bossfight sequence. They eventually stop and Madeline tries to comfort her by trying to say that if
                    they
                    want to leave this area, they need to work together. She starts to understand that it's fine to be
                    scared
                    of being abandoned, and if they want to change something, they need to cooperate. This ends up with
                    them
                    merging into one character, giving Madeline an additional dash. They both start climbing back up,
                    finding
                    Granny and Theo who ran into the chasm to find her. Badeline still doesn't believe they can reach
                    the
                    summit, because of the long fall. At the end Madeline says that they should try once again, and that
                    if
                    they will cooperate, they will sooner or later reach the end again. Badeline agrees, and Madeline
                    leaves
                    her bag with Theo before she tries to climb the mountain again.

                        Chapter 6's Crystal Heart is located at the beginning of the third sub-chapter, Hollows. At the
                        start of
                        the sub-chapter, the player must use the Angry Platform to break through the wall below to get
                        to the
                        first Feather. One must then use it to fly up-right, and then dash down to break the Smashable
                        Wall,
                        revealing the second Feather. The player must use that Feather to fly upwards, then climb to the
                        third
                        Feather, and finally use that Feather to fly to the left of the screen, revealing an entrance to
                        a
                        secret room. After going through the room and breaking another Smashable Wall, the player will
                        see a
                        puzzle with a statue, 6 colored crystals, 4 torches and 3 symbols.
